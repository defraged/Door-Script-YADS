== Door Script ==
This is a simple script for opening and closing doors in OpenSim and Second Life.
It works with standalone doors, with doors that are linked, doors that are "cut" (so that they need simple rotation),
doors that are not cut, sliding doors, paired doors and various combinations.
This script is aimed to be useable for nearly all cases of doors, while at the same time being fast configured (you don't want to edit a huge configuration file for every door in a 50 room apartment, do you?) and causing no lag.

===usage===
The door is configured in the Description Box of the door-prim, there is no need to touch the script. Just drop the script inside the door prim, write a few words in the Description Box and you are ready.
